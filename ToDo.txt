How to know which stocks to trade? AAPL or...?

Other Indicators:
	Money supply growth (M2?...)
	Fed purchases
	Bank info ? Liquidity?
	Real estate (and other alternative investments)
	Sentiment Analysis - Twitter, old news articles
	Mentions in general (not sentiment, but just talk)
		- not only of company, but of products
		- competitor products?
